We corrected the log odds from the logistic estimation in the post-stratification calculations, and calculated
the proportions of votes that the two candidates are each likely to receive. y1 for Trump is 0.4181068, and y2
for Biden is 0.4441705. These results indicate that ~41.81% of voters are willing to vote for Trump, while
another ~44.42% of voters prefer to vote for Biden. The two values do not add up to 100% because as
mentioned above, some respondents either indicated that they would not vote, or did not yet know how they
would vote. Our results predict that Joe Biden will gain more votes in total compared to Trump.
